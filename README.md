# DNS Security Ontology (DSecO)

The **DSecO** project is a data model for representing and reasoning on Domain Name System (DNS) data.
The ontology is developed using web technologies (e.g. RDF, OWL, SKOS) and is intended as a structure for realizing a DNS Knowledge Graph (KG) for administration and security assessment applications.
The model has been developed in collaboration with operational teams, and in connection with third parties linked vocabularies.
