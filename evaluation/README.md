# DNS Security Ontology (DSecO) -- evaluation

This folder holds the datasets, regression test queries, and DNS configuration assessment queries for the **DSecO** project.

The toy example dataset and queries provided here serves both evaluation purposes of the DSecO implementation (a.k.a. regression tests), and as a basis for illustrating the benefits of the DSecO proposal by running DNS assessment use cases defined with a panel of operations experts.
Overall, it demonstrates the feasibility of providing a unified view of DNS records and the practicality of explainable and shareable DNS administration rules for extended analysis and informed decision-making by NetOps and SecOps teams regarding DNS records.

See sub-folders for each specific DSecO release.
